## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant green (#34D399) to reflect growth, learning and freshness, combined with a light background to make the UI feel open and inviting.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FDF4) to provide a soft, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#F59E0B) as a contrasting color for highlights and interactive elements to draw attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Fredoka', sans-serif, for a playful and friendly feel suitable for kids' content. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use icons from 'lucide-react' for a consistent and modern look. Note: This tool already uses lucide-react icons.
- Use a grid layout to arrange the post templates for easy preview and download. Note: The app uses a grid layout for this reason already.
- Subtle scaling animations on hover for interactive buttons.
